## Mistakes I Made Building Pinterest Widgets

Some good things particularly about the strategy of tracking widgets. Haven't found the slides online yet, but it was good.

## Who Killed My Battery: Analyzing Mobile Browser Energy Consumption

Very academic talk, hopefully some of it bleeds into lower-level understanding soon. Very interesting on which sites were battery drainers (spoiler, gmail does very well, wikipedia kills your battery).

Great package of their talk materials, great work: http://bit.ly/ostrichandyak

## Browser Versions Are Dead

Hilarious rant about how we need to stop talking about browser versions, and that it's wasting our time. Speaker has a kickstarter for a JS book series, going for a stretch goal at this writing: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/getify/you-dont-know-js-book-series. His slides from the talk: https://speakerdeck.com/getify/browser-versions-are-dead-v5

## Classical Inheritance is Obsolete: How to Think in Prototypal OO 

Small room, very popular talk. It was nicely structured for many levels, and informative without flashiness. His teaching library https://github.com/dilvie/stampit can help you understand some of the patterns.
