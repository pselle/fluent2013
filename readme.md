# Pam's Fluent 2013 Notes

Rather than do my standard post-event blog post, I thought I'd create a repo to share my notes, and for others to share theirs.

If you'd like to add your notes, fork/pull request, you know the deal. Or mention @pamasaur on Twitter to point me to your notes and I'll add them.

Fluent has a lot of materials here: http://fluentconf.com/fluent2013/public/schedule/proceedings
