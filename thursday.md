## Keynotes/Plenary

### Ben Galbraith & Dion Almaer (Walmart.com)

No notes.

### Bill Scott (Paypal)

About Paypal shipping Node. Quite impressive, but particularly about talking about the transformation of Paypal. 

### Jesse Freeman

Games! Enjoyable to watch, http://impactjs.com/ got good mentions.

### Nicholas Zakas

Non-techical talk on how saying thank you to a book rejection put him on his current path. Great talk, worth watching on video.

### Remote Working Works

A little sloppy on the presentation, but as a pro-remote worker myself, hopefully others learned something.

### Lea Verou

Good intro to the inner workings of W3C. Too bad she was cut off because of time.

## 1.21 gigawatts: ChromeApps with AngularJS and Node

Loved it. I haven't heard a lot of hype at all about ChromeApps (they're just kind of a thing), and this was a super fun and funny presentation from a high level view. Great work.

## Break Out Of The Browser With HTML5 

Followed up the high-level ChromeApps talk with another one that got more into their interesting bits and shortcomings. I still need to research more, but I have some schemes for doing something with them now.

## How To: Make Fast Design-Decisions as a Developer

Not worth much time if you're a skilled full front-end dev (you've heard of Sass). Probably good if you aren't.

## "this" in JavaScript : How It Really Works 

## Prototyping Ã  la Node with Express
